Description:
  'Cross sections of dijets from photoproduction are shown from collisons between protons and electrons/positrons with beam energies 920GeV and 27.5GeV, respectively. Jet with high transverse energies $E_t^{jet1} > 20GeV,\ E_t^{jet2}>15GeV$ were selected. This data is compared to next-to leading order QCD calculations, and measurements were found that show sensitivity to parton distribution functions of both the proton and photon, and to beyond next-to leading order QCD calculations.'
ValidationInfo:
  'A description of the process used to validate the Rivet code against
  the original experimental analysis. Cut-flow tables and similar information
  are welcome'
